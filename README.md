Thriving blocks is a fabric mod that currently adds in building blocks with a terraforming focus.
I used to build landscapes quite often in minecraft and was always annoyed that certain types of blocks didn't exist. So I made them myself!
Does Grassy Stone interest you? How about Sand Paths? Mossy Stone Bricks that adjust to Biome Coloring?

This also includes a good amount of blocks brought back from beta/legacy minecraft under different names.

There are additional compat blocks when played alongside the nature's spirit mod.
